BUSINESS DESCRIPTION: 
Assume we have a new financial lending and holding company. let's develop a program based business model that we can explore and build the business from. To begin, assumed the company is financed with a mix of equity and debt. we will offer digital currency backed cash loans  to our customers that are either collateralized, partially collateralized and uncollateralized.

Tier 1 loans - this loan is fully collateralized by some digital currency (ie BTC,ETH,XRP); to receive loan proceeds, customers must provide custody of the collateral equivalent to the borrowed amount. the mark to market price of the currency the day before the loan origination date is used to finalize the collateral value in dollars or the currency of our choosing. the collateralized value in its original form (digital currency) will be returned to the customer upon full repayment of the loan amount (plus interest and fees). In the case of loan default, the remaining balance is recouped from the collateralized value and any remaining collaterized value is returned to the customer in its original form.There is no credit check whatsoever and all loans are if approved if collaterization requirements are met.

Tier 2 loans - this loan is partially collateralized by some digital currency (ie BTC,ETH,XRP); to receive loan proceeds, customers must provide custody of the collateral equivalent to the agreed upon amount determined by us. the mark to market price of the currency the day before the loan origination date is used to finalize the collateral value in dollars or the currency of our choosing. the collateralized value in its original form (digital currency) will be returned to the customer upon full repayment of the loan amount (plus interest and fees). In the case of loan default, the remaining balance is recouped from the collateralized value and any remaining collaterized value is returned to the customer in its original form. There will be credit worthiness requirements (ie.Transunion score > 625) here and customers may be subject to credit and background checks and collaterization requirements must be met before approval.

Tier 3 loans - this loan is uncollateralized and represent the stardard installment loan. These loans will vary in amount from 10000 to 250000 and will be financed between 7% and 10% at 3mo, 6mo, 1yr, 2yr and 5yr terms. There will be expectional credit worthiness requirements (ie.Transunion score > 700) here and customers may be subject to credit and background checks before approval.
